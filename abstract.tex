This work presents a method to predict the failure of a robotic manipulator's
task due to the flexibility of the elastic bodies that serves as a base. The
errors can be the position, velocity and orientation of the tool attached to the
tip of the robot. The method also provides a way to verify how modifications in
the base design can change the dynamic behaviour of the coupled system.
The motivation of such analysis is the crescent employment of service robots for
\textit{in situ} applications, where the use of a light and slender structure
for the base may be the best and more feasible solution for placing the robot in
the service environment. The analysis are divided as: model the Dynamic
Multibody Systems of the robot, the base and the coupled base-robot, by Kane's
method; find the stiffness matrix of the base, by Finite Element Analysis; find
the Rayleigh parameters of the proportional damping matrix of the base, by
Experimental Modal Analysis.
An \textit{in situ} robotic hardcoating system (EMMA) is chosen as the case of
study. Simulations are done for two different trajectories and three different
bases. The results of the reference model (rigid base) and the coupled model
(robot - flexible base) are then compared and shows the changes in the controled
parameters due to the flexibility of the base. This analysis allows the
verification of compliance to the hardcoating requirements like position,
velocity and orientation of the gun with respect to the surface.
